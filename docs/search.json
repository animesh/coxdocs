    "text": "4.3 Strand specificity\nIt describes which RNA library preparation method was used. Depending on this, reads will mostly be aligned to the same (sense) or opposite (anti-sense) strand as the feature. Alternatively, reads can be aligned to both strands (not stranded).\nLet’s demonstrate an expected distribution of reads according to an imaginary gene, consisting of one transcript, using each type of strand specificity. All reads marked red are those which we will take into account. Reads marked grey will be excluded from the coverage calculation.\n\nWe rule out reads with a mark because there is no intersection between them and the gene.\nAlso, we skip b marked reads because they have an opposite direction to that which we expect.\nLastly, we eliminate reads which don’t fit with the annotation (c) although such reads can potentially be evidence for another isoform of the gene.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Stranded Single End Reads. Expected distribution of reads in a case of stranded and sense assay\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Stranded (anti-sense). Expected distribution of reads in a case of stranded and anti-sense assay\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Not-Stranded reads. Expected distribution of reads in a case of non-stranded assay\n\n\nPaired end sequencing produces two reads from one fragment and they should be from different strands (if reads is aligned to the same strand, we exclude such pairs).\nFor simplicity of visualization let’s represent paired end reads like this (Figure 4)\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Paired-end reads\n\n\nWe represent the paired end read like this for short. Definition of a, b and c marked reads is similar to single end reads’ case.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Paired End Reads, Stranded (sense) or irst read from the pair is on sense strand. Expected distribution of reads in a case of stranded and sense assay\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Stranded (anti-sense)or first read is on anti-sense strand. Expected distribution of reads in a case of stranded and anti-sense assay\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Not-Stranded. Expected distribution of reads in a case of non-stranded assay\n\n\nIt’s worth to notice that for paired end reads the Persues by default calculates number of fragments for each gene, in other words it doesn’t count twice two reads of one pair.\nHint: In case the experimental design isn’t known, we recommend to use “Not stranded” as “Strand specificity”."

Then a new row will be added at the end of the table and a new sequence database form will appear on the right hand side that can be edited.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Adding a new entry to database\n\n\nThen you just have to fill in the form by defining the fasta file that should be used, the parsing rule that should be applied to retrieve the identifiers, the source of the fasta file, the taxonomy and the organism name. To define the parsing rule regular expressions are used. A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern with a special syntax. A good general introduction can be found, as always, on Wikipedia. If you already know generally how regular expressions work, you may only need to glance at a this Quick Reference or at an even quicker Cheat Sheet. Also you don’t have to know the taxonomy of your organism, just type in the name and use the arrows in the taxonomy line and MaxQuant will complete the form.\nDon’t forget to click the “Modify table” button (Figure 4) when you’re done to transfer the changes you made in the form to the table on the left. And to save the table you have to click the “Save changes” button.\nTo have the added sequence database available in MaxQuant you have to open a new MaxQuant window.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Saving the entry in the database"

To do this, use the Load parameters item on the drop-down menu just left of the Raw files tab. A file browser will open so you can load the parameters you want, including the raw data files.\nThe other way to load raw files is by drag-and-drop from a file explorer. The behavior will depend on what you select.\n\nIf you select a single file with an *.xml extension (usually mqpar.xml), the raw data files and other parameters stored there will be loaded.\nIf all of the items you select are recognized as raw data files, then these will be loaded.\nIf any of the items you select is not recognized as a raw data file, then each folder among the selected items will be searched recursively for raw data files. All files found will be loaded. If there are also files which are not recognized as raw data, they will be silently passed over.\n\n\n\n2.2 Load button\nPressing the Load button will open a file chooser window. The filter at the lower right may be selected to choose which type of file-based raw data source is visible and may be selected. Folder-based raw data sources cannot be loaded with this button, but the Load folder button (Section 2.4) can be used for these. The folders may be browsed and single or multiple files can be chosen in the usual way. When you have made your selection, press Open. (Remember, if you have chosen a folder, it will be opened for browsing. To load files, you must have only files selected.) The file or files chosen will be added to the table, unless they are already present there.\n\n\n2.3 Remove button\nThis button removes the selected raw data rows from the table.\n\n\n2.4 Load folder button\nThe Load folder button can be used in three ways:\n\nto open a single, folder-based raw data source,\nto open all the raw data sources of any sort (whether file-based or folder based) in the chosen folder, or\nto open all the raw data sources of any sort anywhere under the chosen folder, that is, recursively.\n\nBecause there could be many items in a directory that are not raw data sources, all such items are silently ignored.\n\n\n2.5 Change folder button\nRaw data files loaded by the buttons or with drag-and-drop will, naturally, exist. When an mqpar.xml file is loaded, however, the files mentioned may no longer exist. For example, some processing of the files may have been done and a parameter file saved, but the files subsequently moved to another folder or drive. If the files are still together, the situation may be saved by telling MaxQuant where to find them now. When you press the Change folder button you will be presented with the part of the path that the files in the table have in common and given the opportunity to change it to the path that is currently correct, either by editing or by browsing."

If this is the case, we have good news for you. In almost all user cases the standard values of most parameters are fine and you only need to adjust a small number of factors. Typically there is only little information that you need to provide. Every parameter in the interface has context help which you obtain by hovering with the mouse pointer over the text string for this parameter. This documentation also has that information, and more.\nYou will have to tell MaxQuant where to find your raw data files and your fasta files, and which labels and digestion enzymes you are using. 90% of the time that will be enough, and you can leave the rest of the bells and whistles on their default values.

    "text": "Andromeda1 is a peptide search engine based on probabilistic scoring. On proteome data, Andromeda performs as well as Mascot, a widely used commercial search engine, as judged by sensitivity and specificity analysis based on target decoy searches.\nIt can handle data with arbitrarily high fragment mass accuracy, it is also able to assign and score complex patterns of post-translational modifications, such as highly phosphorylated peptides, and accommodates extremely large databases. Andromeda can function independently or integrated into MaxQuant. This combination enables analysis of large datasets on a desktop computer. Identification of co-fragmented peptides improves the number of identified peptides.\nTo run Andromeda, you will need .NET framework 4.5.\n\n1 Documentation outline\nThis documentation is organized as a wiki, so if you find anything that is wrong or hard to understand, please let us know.
