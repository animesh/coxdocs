# Brief description

Multi-sample test for determining if any of the means of several groups is significantly different from each other.

Output: A numerical columns is added containing the p-value. In addition there is a categorical column added in which it is indicated by a '+' when the row is significant with respect to the specified criteria.

# Parameters

## Grouping

Selected categorical row that defines the grouping of columns that should be used in the test (default: first categorical row in the matrix).

## Test

Defines what kind of test should be applied (default: ANOVA). The test can be selected from a predefined list:

-   ANOVA
-   Kruskal Wallis

### S0

Artificial within groups variance (default: 0). It controls the relative importance of t-test p-value and difference between means. At $s0=0$ only the p-value matters, while at nonzero s0 also the difference of means plays a role. See [@tusher2001] for details.

## Use for truncation

Defines on what value the truncation is based on (default: Permutation-based FDR). Choose here whether the truncation should be based on the p-values, on permutation-based FDR-values or, if the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple hypothesis testing should be applied.

### Threshold p-value

This parameter is just relevant, if the parameter "Use for truncation" is set to "P-value". Rows with a test result below this value are reported as significant (default: 0.05).

### FDR

This parameter is just relevant, if the parameter "Use for truncation" is set to "Benjamini-Hochberg FDR" or "Permutation-based FDR". Rows with a test result below this value are reported as significant (default: 0.05).

### Number of randomizations

Specifies the number of randomizations that should be applied (default: 250).

### Preserve grouping in randomizations

Defines, whether the grouping specified in a categorical row should be preserved in the randomizations (default: `<None>`). It can be selected from a list including all available groupings of the matrix.

## Log10

If checked, $-Log_{10}(test\ value)$ is reported in the output matrix (default). Otherwise the test-value is reported.

## Suffix

The entered suffix will be attached to newly generated columns (default: empty). That way columns from multiple runs of the test can be distinguished more easily.
