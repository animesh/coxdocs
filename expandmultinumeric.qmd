# General

  * **Type:** - Matrix Processing
  * **Heading:** - Rearrange
  * **Source code:** [ExpandMultiNumeric.cs](https://github.com/JurgenCox/perseus-plugins/blob/master/PerseusPluginLib/Rearrange/ExpandMultiNumeric.cs)

# Brief description

Distribute multiple values per cell in a multi-numeric column over multiple rows. For each row in the original matrix there will be as many rows created as there are numbers in the cell of the multi-numeric column. 
If multiple multi-numeric columns are selected they have to have the same number of values in every row. Elements of text columns, if one is selected, are interpreted as semicolon-separated. They also have to have the same number of semicolon-separated elements as there are values in the cell(s) of the multi-numeric columns(s).

Output: Columns are the same. The number of rows increases due to the expansion.


# Parameters

## Multi-numeric columns

Selected multi-numeric columns that should be expanded using the procedure mentioned in the description section above (default: no columns are selected).

## Text columns

Selected text columns that should be expanded using the procedure mentioned in the description section above (default: no columns are selected).
