# Parameters

## Grouping

Defines, which grouping specified in a categorical row should be used to average values (default: first categorical row in the matrix).

## Average type

Specifies which operation should be applied for the averaging (default: Median). The operation can be selected from a predefined list:

-   Median
-   Mean
-   Sum
-   Geometric mean

## Min. valid values per group

Defines the minimal values a group must contain to calculate the average (default: 1).

## Keep original data

If checked the original data will be kept In the output matrix (default: unchecked).

## Add variation

Specifies, whether a measure of group-wise variation should be calculated and displayed in a numerical column (default: `<None>`). The measure can be selected from a predefined list:

-   `<None>`
-   Standard deviation
-   Error of mean
