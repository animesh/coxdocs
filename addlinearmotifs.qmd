# General

-   **Type:** - Matrix Processing
-   **Heading:** - Modifications
-   **Source code:** not public.

# Brief description

Given a column containing the sequence window centered around modification sites, linear motifs are matched to these sequences and a potential kinase or binding partner is suggested. The motifs are defined in the File `conf\motifs.txt`

Output: Same matrix with a categorical column added which contains the kinases or binding partners which are recognized based on the linear sequence motif.
