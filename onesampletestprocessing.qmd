# Brief description

One sample-test for determining if the mean is significantly different from a fixed value (typically 0).

Output: Two numerical columns are added, one containing the p-value, the other containing the difference between the mean and the fixed value (which is usually 0). In addition there is a categorical column added in which it is indicated by a  '+' when the row is significant with respect to the specified criteria.
