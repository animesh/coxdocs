# Download

Downloading and using the software is free of charge.

Simply download from [here](https://maxquant.org/) and unpack the compressed file `MaxQuant.zip`.

# Running

Please choose your operating system to view how to run MaxQuant.

## MaxQuant on Windows {#sec-mq-windows}

Supported operation system versions (64 bit is required) are Windows 10 or 11 or Windows Server 2016, 2019, 2022.

-   **Install .NET Framework 4.7.3 or higher**: To find out whether you already have it, follow the instructions on [How to Determine Which .NET Framework Versions Are Installed](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh925568%28v=vs.110%29.aspx#net_b). If you need to, you can download the software and get installation instructions at the [Microsoft Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653).

We are currently working on making MaxQuant compatible with .Net 7.
This will be bring further advantages to speed and stability of the tool.

-   **Run MaxQuant GUI** Double click on `MaxQuant.exe` in the `MaxQuant` folder and specify your RAW files, experimental design and fasta files.

-   **Start MaxQuant** Click on the `Start` button.

## MaxQuant on Linux

We are supporting MaxQuant on Ubuntu 20.04 or higher, but MaxQuant should also work on another distribution of Linux.
You may run MaxQuant using Graphical User Interface.
In this case, you should install Mono and follow instructions in @sec-mq-windows for **MaxQuant on Windows** starting from second point.
This tutorial is focused on running MaxQuant using command line.

-   **Install .NET Core 3.1** To find out whether you already have it, type in the command line

``` bash
dotnet --version
```

If you see at least version $3.1.100$, then everything is ready to start MaxQuant.

Otherwise you need to follow the installation instructions at [.NET Core SDK 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/3.1) for your operating system.

Ubuntu 22.04 (for example)

``` bash
wget https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/20.04/packages-microsoft-prod.deb -O packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo dpkg -i packages-microsoft-prod.deb
sudo apt-get update; \
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https && \
sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-2.1
```

-   **Edit mqpar.xml file**

Currently we highly recommend to preconfigure the `mqpar.xml` file in MaxQuant GUI. After transferring the file on Linux machine, do not forget to update file addresses accordingly.
You can also use a programmatic way to change that.

``` bash
dotnet MaxQuant/bin/MaxQuantCmd.exe --changeFolder=new_mqpar.xml <new folder with fasta files> <new folder with raw files> old_mqpar.xml
```

However if you feel familiar with a structure of `mqpar.xml`, you may create a template of `mqpar.xml` and edit it directly.

``` bash
dotnet MaxQuant/bin/MaxQuantCmd.exe --create new_mqpar.xml
```

-   **Run MaxQuant**

``` bash
dotnet MaxQuant/bin/MaxQuantCmd.exe mqpar.xml
```

# Hardware requirements

-   4 GB RAM minimum.
-   4 GB RAM per thread that is executed in parallel is required.
-   There is no upper limit on the number of cores. Whatever you can fit into a shared memory machine will work as long as the disk performance scales up with it.

Here we list some example hardware configurations that we are using in the lab and that we are quite happy with. These are mere examples and there is no reason to prefer specific vendors or brands.
