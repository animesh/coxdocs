The Perseus software platform supports biological and biomedical researchers in interpreting protein quantification, interaction and post-translational modification data. Perseus contains a comprehensive portfolio of statistical tools for high-dimensional omics data analysis covering normalization, pattern recognition, time-series analysis, cross-omics comparisons and multiple-hypothesis testing (for an overview see @fig-perseus). A machine learning module supports the classification and validation of patient groups for diagnosis and prognosis, and it also detects predictive protein signatures. Central to Perseus is a user-friendly, interactive workflow environment that provides complete documentation of computational methods used in a publication[@tyanova2016].

# Pronunciation of Perseus

Most biologists and informaticians are a little weak in the classical languages. Fortunately, Google helps you catch up on any lessons you missed. The developers in Germany tend to say _pair-SAY-oos_, with the accent on the second of three syllables, which seems reasonably close to the Greek pronunciation [given here](http://www.greek-gods.info/greek-heroes/sounds/perseus_greek.mp3)] or [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uhtz6nCGXcM).
(This pronunciation is distinct from how Germans usually call the Greek hero, which is _PAIR-soys_.)

The English pronunciation uniformly puts the accent on the first syllable: PER-see-uhs, as in the examples [here](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/pronounce/english/Perseus), [here](http://www.greek-gods.info/greek-heroes/sounds/perseus_english.mp3), or [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uo96zYcmE0Q). For the software there is no official pronunciation, so no one will tell you you are wrong, as long as you say it with confidence.


# Learn

-   Hands-on tutorials and theoretical lectures are available on the [MaxQuant youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKYzYTm1cnmc0CFAMhxDO8w).
-   Participate in our annual [MaxQuant summer school](http://summerschool.maxquant.de) to gain even deeper insights into MaxQuant and Perseus. Read the protocol-style book chapter ([@tyanova2018] on Perseus.
-   Join the discussion around Perseus and data analysis on the [perseus google group](https://groups.google.com/g/perseus-list) -- a great place to ask any question and get answers from the community.
