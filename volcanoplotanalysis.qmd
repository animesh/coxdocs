# Brief description

Visualize the results of a t-test in the form of a volcano plot. Determine significant data points with a permutation-based FDR calculation.

# Parameters

## Grouping

Selected categorical row that defines the grouping of columns that should be used in the specified "Test" (default: first categorical row in the matrix).

### First Group (right)

First selected group that should be used for the specified "Test" (default: first group of the previously selected categorical row in the matrix). The group can be selected from all defined groups of the categorical row defined in "Grouping".

### Second Group (left)

Second selected group that should be used for the specified "Test" (default: first group of the previously selected categorical row in the matrix). The group can be selected from all defined groups of the categorical row defined in "Grouping".

## Test

Defines what kind of test should be applied (default: T-test).

## Side

To apply a two-sided test, where the null hypothesis can be rejected regardless of the direction of the effect "both" has to be selected (default). "left" and "right" are the respective one-sided tests.

## Number of randomizations

Specifies the number of randomizations that should be applied (default: 250).

## Preserve grouping in randomizations

Defines, whether the grouping specified in a categorical row should be preserved in the randomizations (default: `<None>`). It can be selected from a list including all available groupings of the matrix.

## FDR

Rows with a test result below this value are reported as significant (default: 0.05).

## S0

Artificial within groups variance (default: 0). It controls the relative importance of t-test p-value and difference between means. At s0=0 only the p-value matters, while at nonzero s0 also the difference of means plays a role. See [@tusher2001] for details.
