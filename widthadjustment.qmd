# Brief description

The first, second and third quartiles ($q1$, $q2$, $q3$) are calculated from the  distribution of all values. The second quartile (which is the median) is subtracted from each value to center the distribution. Then we divide by the width in an asymmetric way. All values that are  positive after subtraction of the median are divided by $q3 - q2$ while all negative values are divided by $q2 - q1$.
