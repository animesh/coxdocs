#Parameters

## Indicated are

Specification whether rows containing the "Indicator" in the categorical column specified in "In column" correspond to the class under observation or not (default: False).

## In column

Selected categorical column containing the class membership of each instance (row) of the class under observation (default: first categorical column in the matrix).

## Indicator

Rows containing the defined string are counted as true or false depending on the selection in "Indicated are" (default: $+$).

## Scores

Selected expression columns containing the scores by which the rows are ranked to calculate the specified quantities (default: first expression column of the matrix is selected).

## Large values are good

If checked the larger the score value the better (default: checked). Otherwise the lower the value the better.

## Display quantity

Selected quantities that will be calculated (default: no quantities are selected). The quantities can be selected from a predefined list:

-   $TP/(TP+FP)$ (Precision)
-   $TP/(TP+FN)$ (Recall)
-   $FP/TP$
-   $TP/NP$
-   $TP/(TP+FN)$ (Sensitivity)
-   $TN/(TN+FP)$ (Specificity)
