# General

  * **Type:** - Matrix Processing
  * **Heading:** - Outliers
  * **Source code:** [SignificanceA.cs](https://github.com/JurgenCox/perseus-plugins/blob/master/PerseusPluginLib/Significance/SignificanceA.cs)

# Brief description

Determines which values are significant outliers relative to a certain population. For details see Cox and Mann [@cox2008]


Output: A numerical column is added containing the significance A value. Furthermore, a categorical column is added indicating by '+' if a row is significant.

# Parameters

## Columns

Selected expression columns for which "Significance A" should be calculated (default: no expression columns are selected).

## Side

To apply a two-sided test, where the null hypothesis can be rejected regardless of the direction of the effect "both" has to be selected (default). "left" and "right" are the respective one-sided tests.

## Use for truncation

The truncation can be based on p-values or the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple hypothesis testing (default: Benjamini-Hochberg FDR). Rows with a test result below a specified value (parameter below) are reported as significant.

## Threshold value

Based on a specified threshold a specific row is reported as significant (default: 0.05). Depending on the chosen truncation score this threshold value is applied to the p-value or to the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR.
