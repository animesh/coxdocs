#Parameters

## Columns

Selected expression columns for which "Significance A" should be calculated (default: no expression columns are selected).

## Side

To apply a two-sided test, where the null hypothesis can be rejected regardless of the direction of the effect "both" has to be selected (default). "left" and "right" are the respective one-sided tests.

## Use for truncation

The truncation can be based on p-values or the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple hypothesis testing (default: Benjamini-Hochberg FDR). Rows with a test result below a specified value (parameter below) are reported as significant.

## Threshold value

Based on a specified threshold a specific row is reported as significant (default: 0.05). Depending on the chosen truncation score this threshold value is applied to the p-value or to the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR.
