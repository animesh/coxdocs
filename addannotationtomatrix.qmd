# Brief description

Based on a column containing protein (or gene or transcript) identifiers this activity adds columns with annotations.

# Parameters

## Source

Specified path to the file containing the annotations that should be added to the matrix (default: first file in Perseus-version `/conf/annotations/`). The file can be selected from all files in Perseus-version `/conf/annotations/`.

### ENSG column

Selected text column that contains the base identifier, which are going to be matched to the annotations (default: first text column in the matrix).

### Annotations to be added

Selected annotations that should be added (default: no annotations are selected). The annotations can be selected from a list of annotations defined by the tab separated columns in the file specified in "Source".

## Additional sources

Selected files containing the annotations that should additionally be added to the matrix (default: no files are selected). Additional sources can be selected from all files in Perseus-version `conf/annotations`.
