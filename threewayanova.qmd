# Parameters

## First Grouping

Selected categorical row that defines the first grouping of columns that should be used in the test (default: first categorical row in the matrix).

## Second Grouping

Selected categorical row that defines the second grouping of columns that should be used in the test (default: first categorical row in the matrix).

## Third Grouping

Selected categorical row that defines the third grouping of columns that should be used in the test (default: first categorical row in the matrix).

## -Log10

If checked, -Log10(test value) is reported in the output matrix (default). Otherwise the test-value is reported.

## Suffix

The entered suffix will be attached to newly generated columns (default: empty). That way columns from multiple runs of the test can be distinguished more easily.
