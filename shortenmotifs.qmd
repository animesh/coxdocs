# Parameters

## Sequence window

Selected text column that contains the amino acid sequences (default: first text column in the matrix).

## Start

Start position of the newly generated shorter sequences, which are displayed in a new generated text column called "Short sequence window" (default: 6). The flanks will be measured with respect to this position.

**Hint**: Start + Length cannot exceed the length of any protein sequence in the selected text column.

## Length

Length of the newly generated sequences (default: 11). Flanking regions of this length will be kept surrounding the central position.
