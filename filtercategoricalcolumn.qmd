# Parameters

## Column

Selected categorical column the filtering is based on (default: first categorical column of the matrix).

## Values

Rows with the containing values will be kept/discarded depending on the selected "Mode" (default: no values are selected).

## Mode

The rows with the selected values will be kept/discarded depending on the selected "Mode" (default: "Remove matching rows").
If "Remove matching rows" is selected, rows having the values will be removed while all other rows will be kept.
If "Keep matching rows" is selected, the opposite will happen.

## Filter mode

The "Filter mode" defines, whether the input matrix will be reduced ("Reduce matrix" = default) or a new categorical column called "Filter" will be generated containing the categories "Keep" and "Discard" ("Filter mode" = "Add categorical column").
