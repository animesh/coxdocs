# Parameters

## Operation

Specifies the operation (default: $x-y$), how a pair of columns should be combined into a single column. Numbers with $.$ as decimal point, $+$, $-$, $*$, $/$ and \^ as well as scientific notation (e.g. $5.4e{-12}$) can be used. A set of predefined functions are also available, whose argument has to be enclosed by round brackets, e.g. $sin(2*x-y)$.

## x

Selected expression columns that are the first partners of pairs of columns (default: no expression columns are selected). The number of selected columns in the "x" and "y" field must be the same.

## y

Selected expression columns that are the second partners of pairs of columns (default: no expression columns are selected). The number of selected columns in the "x" and "y" field must be the same.

## Keep original columns

If checked the original columns will be retained in the output matrix (default: checked).
