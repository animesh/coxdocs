# Parameters

## Column

Selected text column the filtering is based on (default: first text column in the matrix).

## Search string

Specified text string that should be searched in the previously defined text column (default: empty).

## Match case

If checked, the cells of the text column will be searched for a matching substring (default: unchecked).
The results will be in a new generated categorical column called "Search: original column name".
"+" indicates, whether a match was successful.

## Match whole word

If checked, the text column will be searched to match the whole word of the specified term (default: checked).
The results will be in a new generated categorical column called "Search: original column name".
"+" indicates, whether a match was successful.

## Mode

The rows with the selected values will be kept/discarded depending on the selected "Mode" (default: "Remove matching rows").
If "Remove matching rows" is selected, rows having the values will be removed while all other rows will be kept.
If "Keep matching rows" is selected, the opposite will happen.

## Filter mode

The "Filter mode" defines, whether the input matrix will be reduced ("Reduce matrix" = default) or a new categorical column called "Filter" will be generated containing the categories "Keep" and "Discard" ("Filter mode" = "Add categorical column").
