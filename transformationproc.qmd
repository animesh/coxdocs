# Parameters

## Transformation

The specified transformation formula (default: $log_2(x)$) that should be applied to all cells in the selected columns. The variable name is $x$. Numbers with $.$ are reagrded decimal point, $+$, $-$, $*$, $/$ and \^ can be used as well as scientific notation (e.g. $2.9e^{-15}$) is supported. Predefined functions can also be used, whose argument has to be enclosed by round brackets, e.g. $sin(2*x)$.

## Columns

Selected expression and/or numerical columns, where the transformation should be applied (default: all columns are selected).
