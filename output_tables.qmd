MaxQuant produces multiple Output tables:

## Summary Table
			
The summary file contains summary information for all the raw files processed with a single MaxQuant run. The 
summary information consists of some MaxQuant parameters, information of the raw file contents, and statistics on 
the peak detection. Based on this file a quick overview can be gathered on the quality of the data in the raw file.

The last row in this file contains the summary information for each column on each of the processed files.
