# General

-   **Type:** - Matrix Processing
-   **Heading:** - Normalization
-   **Source code:** [ZScore.cs](https://github.com/JurgenCox/perseus-plugins/blob/master/PerseusPluginLib/Norm/ZScore.cs)

# Brief description

The mean of each row/column is subtracted from each value.
The result is then divided by the standard deviation of the row/column.

Output: Normalized expression matrix.

# Parameters

## Matrix access

Specifies whether the z-scoring is performed on rows or columns (default: Rows).

### Grouping

This parameter is just relevant, if the "Matrix access" is set to "Rows".
It specifies, whether the normalization should be applied separately on groups (default: <No grouping>).

## Use median

If checked, the median and not the mean of each row/column is used for the calculation of the z-score of each matrix cell (default: unchecked).

## Report mean and std. dev.

If checked, the mean and the standard deviation used for the calculation are reported (default: unchecked).
In case the z-scoring is based on rows ("Matrix access" = "Rows"), the calculated mean and standard deviation appear in 2 newly generated numeric columns called "Mean" and "Std. dev." containing the mean and standard deviation of each row.
In case the calculation is based on columns ("Matrix access" = "Columns"), 2 new numeric rows are generated containing the mean and standard deviation of each column.
